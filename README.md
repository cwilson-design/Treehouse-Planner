# Treehouse Planner  

The Treehouse Planner is designed to assist you in the initial planning phase of building an amazing treehouse. Whether you're evaluating trees for suitability, assessing tree safety, or drafting accurate scaled layouts for platforms, beams, walls, and posts, this tool aims to streamline your treehouse construction process.

## Features

- **Tree Evaluation:** Assess the suitability of trees based on various criteria.
- **Tree Safety:** Evaluate tree safety factors to ensure stability and reliability.
- **Scaled Layout Planning:** Generate accurately scaled plans for treehouse platforms, beams, walls, and posts.
- **Visualization:** Visualize example tree platform layouts to inspire your designs.
